# Argos Swerve Abstraction

An example implementation of an abstraction method for constructing a swerve drivetrain using tools from [WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib) and [ArgosLib](https://github.com/FRC1756-Argos/ArgosLib-Cpp)

Documentation is in the **Docs** folder (/src/argos_lib/Docs) of the repository, and describe how to use the abstracted drivetrain construction method provided by `argos_swerve.*` 
and a little on the contents of `argos_imu.h`.

## Notes

- This has not been tested with anything more/less than 4 modules. 

## TODO

- Test device configuration
- Test in a scenario with homing set up / used
